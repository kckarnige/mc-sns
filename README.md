[![It's about the journey. (Modpack title)](https://iatj-modpack.github.io/res/modpack_title_4k.png)](https://iatj-modpack.github.io/)

(Includes a [Vanilla Tweaks Resource Pack](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#3qXD7K))

***This modpack is optimized for controller support, with [Controlify](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify) built-in!***

***This pack should also be compatible with [Vivecraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/vivecraft), however it hasn't been thoroughly tested.***

This is a modpack focused on improving Minecraft while still managing to feel oddly vanilla.
From Eyes of Ender being a process to craft, to Diamond and Netherite tools not having impossible durability, this modpack is meant to be fun for single and multiplayer, making what I would say a complete game.

  <summary>Basic Progression</summary>
  
  Progressions works a little different from Vanilla.<br>
  
  Instead of just punching trees your first day, you need to punch rocks too.<br>
  You need to obtain flint from rocks scattered across the overworld to craft the first tier of tools, flint.<br>

  Afterwards, you may want to head to the mines, but instead of looking for just the surface stone, you'll need to dig deeper and dig up some copper and maybe grab some coal.<br>

  After you head back to the surface and start smelting, you may notice you're getting copper *nuggets*, these can be crafted into copper ingots, which brings us to our next big change: tool crafting.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Getting an Upgrade..?</summary>
  
  Tool progression requires you to use your ingots to craft plates, so instead of using ingots to make that beautiful pickaxe, you'll need to craft 3 plates (Unlesss it's made of Copper or Flint).<br>

  Every crafting recipe that would normally require ingots, now requires plates, and that includes Netherite upgrades.<br>

  So go on, get to mining, this is **Mine**craft after all!

<details>
  <summary>Interior Decor</summary>
  
  There's more than enough craftable furniture to make your house feel more comfortable, so don't be afraid to experiment!<br>
  
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Late Progression</summary>
  
  Normally you would probably be able to get to the dragon with iron or even stone tools, not here.<br>

  To craft Eyes of Ender, you'll need an "End Catalyst". This item is crafted with a Nether star, a phantom membrane, two echo shards, one blaze powder, and 4 Ender pearls.<br>
  
  Putting this item in a crafting table with 4 other pearls will get you 4 Eyes of Ender, but be careful, holding the catalyst for extended periods of time may cause sickness.<br>

</details>


<details>
  <summary>Post-game Progression</summary>
  
  After you defeat the dragon, you have the opertunity to summon her once again.<br>
  With every time you fight the dragon, the value of your rewards will increase.<br>
  
  Just make sure you don't have any ominious potions before the fight, it could get hectic.<br>
